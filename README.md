## Developer Information
Many of the error checking the script does involves checking if the elementâ€™s display property has been altered. This is because Virgin made it so that the error dialog is created regardless if there's an error or not. In the event of an error, one of the classes relating to that error type will be made visible to the user. This is done by changing the display property from `display: none;` to `display: block;`
